# Clean Architecture Mindset

## Values 

Clean Architecture works best when all programmers share the same mindset, or at the very least understand and apply its mindset.

*We are uncovering better ways of writing code and architecting software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:*

**Expressing the domain simply** over expressing the domain via tools and frameworks

**Executable documentation** over non-executable documentation

**Customer usage, deferring technology choices** over fitting customer usage into technology choices 

**Delivering value with low cost of change** over delivering hard to change value sooner 

*That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.*

## Principles

* Code rots and becomes a big ball of mud when programmers fear changing code
* Applying a sound strategy for preventing the introduction of defects, such as TDD, unpins eliminating fear. [(semantic stability)](https://www.madetech.com/blog/semantically-stable-test-suites) 
* Refactoring can occur at any time when there is no fear
* When the team understanding of the domain improves, keeping the in-code model of the domain up to date is important.
* The SOLID and package principles provide a guide to aid good software design
